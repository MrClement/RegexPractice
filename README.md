### Regex Practice

To complete this exercise, complete the following steps:
 - Clone this repo
 - Write some words (one per line) into good.txt and bad.txt. They should have some common/uncommon elements to make the regex more interesting
 - Send your good.txt and bad.txt to another student, get new versions from another student
 - Run the command ```npm test```
 - Complete index.js and pass all the tests
 - Don't share your solution quite yet, save it (comment it out) and grab a second set of text files
 - Repeat!
